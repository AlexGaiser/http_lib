This folder represents abstraction Layer 1. 

This is the highest level of abstraction and is the only layer that should be 
exposed to the user. 

This layer is where we expose a simple and easy to use interface for the user 
It is also responsible for making sure user input is validated and put into a predictable
format other layers can use.

This layer needs to have knowledge of the underlying layers structures. 

We will need adaptors to convert configs into things other, lower layers can consumer
