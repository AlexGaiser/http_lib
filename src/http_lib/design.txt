To create a HTTP library we will need:

A mechanism to manage socket connections:
Will need to: 
  Create
  Destroy
  Write to
  Manage buffer stream?

HTTP request builder
Responsible for taking a simple object and converting it into the 
formatted string string required for sending the request
bodies may be large so may need to manage buffering of bodies

HTTP Parser
will need to parse http request
will potentially need to support parsing and reading partial chunks


Request Library (abstract)
  Simple class methods for sending requests
  Support major HTTP methods
  Mimic Axios interface at highest level (config object with methods, params etc)
  Should support Promises (MVP +)
  

Design philosophy:

Layer 1
User should be able to either pass in a request as a config or invoke
different methods on the object to make the request

Layer 2
Request object created by user gets converted into raw http request headers


Layer 3
Socket is opened and raw information is written to the socket
Socket is closed here
