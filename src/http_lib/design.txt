To create a HTTP library we will need:

A mechanism to manage socket connections:
Will need to: 
  Create
  Destroy
  Write to
  Manage buffer stream?

HTTP request builder
Responsible for taking a simple object and converting it into the 
formatted string string required for sending the request
bodies may be large so may need to manage buffering of bodies

Request Library (abstract)
  Simple class methods for sending requests
  Support major HTTP methods
  Mimic Axios interface at highest level (config object with methods, params etc)
  Should support Promises (MVP +)
